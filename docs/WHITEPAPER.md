# Immutable Material Lifecycle System
## Whitepaper

## Abstract
This whitepaper describes the Immutable Material Lifecycle System (IMLS), a
conceptual and technical framework for representing fixed, irreversible
digital material transformations.

The system models digital material behavior analogously to physical processes
such as transformation, entropy, decay, and permanent historical residue.
Once a material enters the system, it may transition through a predefined
sequence of one-way states. These transitions are irreversible by design and
cannot be undone, reversed, or bypassed.

IMLS is not an economic system, financial instrument, governance mechanism,
or incentive structure. It does not promise appreciation, yield, rewards,
or future value. Any meaning, cultural significance, or external utility that
emerges from system participation is incidental and not engineered or
guaranteed by the system itself.

The purpose of this document is to formally specify system behavior, define
invariants and constraints, establish public prior art, and provide an
implementation-neutral reference for experimentation and research into
irreversible digital state systems.
