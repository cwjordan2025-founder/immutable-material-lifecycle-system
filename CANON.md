CANONICAL SPECIFICATION

Canonical Declaration

This repository defines the canonical and authoritative specification of the GLOP → HARD G → DUST lifecycle.

The processes, transformations, and invariants defined herein are intentional, deterministic, and irreversible. Once deployed, no upgrade path, governance mechanism, administrative intervention, or external input may alter these rules.

Any implementation, fork, extension, or derivative work that modifies core lifecycle logic, reversibility, or decay behavior is non-canonical by definition, regardless of intent, popularity, or adoption.

Canonical status is not a claim of finality or perfection. It is a declaration of unalterable rules.


---

Canonical Entities

GLOP — The initial, unstaked state

HARD G — The staked, time-bound hardened state

DUST — The terminal output produced from HARD G


These entities represent distinct lifecycle phases, not interchangeable assets.


---

Canonical Lifecycle

The lifecycle proceeds strictly forward:

GLOP → HARD G → DUST

There are no reverse paths.

GLOP may be staked to become HARD G

HARD G may resolve into DUST

DUST is terminal and inert


Once a transition occurs, prior states are permanently inaccessible.


---

Canonical Invariants

The following invariants are non-negotiable:

Lifecycle transitions are one-directional only

HARD G cannot revert to GLOP

DUST cannot revert to HARD G or GLOP

Decay or output variance derives strictly from stake duration

All calculations are oracle-free and deterministic

No price feeds, governance votes, or admin keys influence outcomes

All state transitions occur on-chain


Any system that violates one or more of these invariants is non-canonical.


---

Authority and Jurisdiction

This document is the highest authority on canonical behavior.

In the event of ambiguity between:

Code and documentation

Implementations and explanations

Forks and derivatives


The interpretation that most strictly preserves irreversibility, determinism, and forward-only lifecycle behavior shall be considered canonical.


---

Explicitly Non-Canonical

The following are intentionally outside the canon and may change without affecting canonical status:

User interfaces and UX decisions

Visual branding and naming outside lifecycle entities

Distribution mechanisms and allocations

Secondary market behavior

Integrations, wrappers, or external tooling


These elements must not modify or bypass canonical lifecycle rules.


---

Final Note

Canonical systems derive legitimacy from constraint, not flexibility.

This specification exists to remove ambiguity, prevent drift, and ensure the lifecycle behaves identically regardless of environment, incentives, or future participation.
