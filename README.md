## Executive Summary (Verbatim Canonical Inclusion)

This repository documents a fixed, irreversible digital material lifecycle system
modeled on real-world physical transformation and entropy.

The system is not an investment product, yield mechanism, financial instrument,
or governance system. It defines a predetermined lifecycle in which a single
fungible digital material may be irreversibly committed, passively decay, and later
be exited into a permanent historical artifact.

The system does not promise appreciation, rewards, access, or future utility.
It records irreversible actions and preserves their outcomes as immutable history.

Any meaning, value, or cultural significance that develops is emergent and external,
not guaranteed or engineered.

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Establish public prior art
- Define immutable system scope and invariants
- Document non-financial posture
- Provide implementation-neutral specifications

This repository does **not**:
- Offer tokens for sale
- Describe tokenomics or allocations
- Promise economic outcomes
- Provide investment guidance

## Document Authority

1. Canonical Concept Packet (conceptual authority)
